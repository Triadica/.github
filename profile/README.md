WebGPU.art contains several experiments on WebGL/WebGPU rendering:

- **Triadica** is a WebGL wrapper on tgwl
- **Lagopus** is a rewrite of Triadica in WebGPU, and is active, also got TypeScript base.
- **Touch Control** is the camera component used in all projects
- **Protea** is compute shader with segments rendering
- **Soluble** is compute shader with SDF rendering
- **wgsl-shadertoy** is a small toy for trying WGSL

Main language is [Calcit](http://calcit-lang.org/), and some are using TypeScript.
